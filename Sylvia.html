    <p id="sylviaExcerpt">“You care, Clyde. In your own weird way. You remind me of my brother.” 
        “Oh Sylvia-” Before I know it, I’m closing the infinitely long gap between us by hugging
        her. I’ve never hugged her before, though I’ve thought about it a thousand times. She doesn’t resist, much to my surprise. Instead, she starts to cry. Her tears are silent, but her body gets warmer and I can feel the droplets slide down my neck and my chest. Her small living room seems to grow to the size of a warehouse.
        “Can’t you stop this all from happening?” She asks so quietly that I can barely hear it. The walls have finally come down. This was what was behind the storm. She lets herself melt into my arms for just a moment. The world stills, the enemy Time comes to a halt. Warmth and dark blue ribbons circle our bodies, a suspension of seconds. My breaths, in and out, span for hours. The sun remains fixed just over the horizon in the windows behind us. Birds quiet, even the grass ceases to move. We sit perfectly still.
        After what could have only been a minute, she stirrs and wipes her tears. Her voice steadies again. “There’s no point in being alive.”
        “Oh, darling..” I say, running my fingers through her hair.</p>
        <br>
        <p id="sylviaExcerpt">That night, I fall asleep next to her. This is against our protocol. She goes to sleep early, with the sun, and I figure that I will wake in a moment if I let myself drift. The room closes in around us, capturing us. I savor each second next to her as the world gently fades.
        I dream of her, emaciated, scared, thirteen years old, crouched at the bottom of her bedroom floor, her papers and drawings strewn around her. The air seems to be in a slight static around her shrunken body. I am in her room, but it’s not me. I’m not really there. I am just an empty entity, only perceiving. A hollow seeing eye. I cannot reach her. I move closer to her, but it’s a camera zoom rather than a walking movement. The gap between us lengthens instead of shortens with each step. I start to hear scratching sounds and muffled screams as I move closer. Trying to call out to her, I move forward. Then the stench of a rotten body hits me. She’s dead. I pry open her eyelids and they are vacant, displaying nothing. After a moment, my
        reflection starts to form in them. My heart stops. Everything stops. The stench of death gets stronger and I can’t move. My ears begin to ring so loud that it wakes me up. </p>
        <br>
        <p id="sylviaExcerpt">My real eyelids shoot open, and I instinctively grab my skin to make sure it’s still there. It is. Solid, wet with sweat, but intact. I let go of the breath I was holding. Quietly, I move to Sylvia’s body to make sure she’s still breathing. She is. Thank God. She is alive now, here now, warm now, and I’ve got to go.
        In a blind sprint, I gather my things and rush out the door, beginning the drive home. The air is freezing, my seat is freezing, the steering wheel is freezing. My car whirrs to life and the radio shouts, trying in vain to push the image of the dead girl out of my mind.</p>
