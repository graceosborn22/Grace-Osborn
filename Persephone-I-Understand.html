    <h2>Persephone, I understand</h2>
    <p>
    </br></br>
When the young girl was picking flowers</br>
They couldn’t just leave her well enough alone</br>
She, so young, was fetishized</br>
Every lamb must be slaughtered</br>
Why, was a girl so young and innocent</br>
The goddess of fertility</br>
    </br>
Why are representations of fertility</br>
Always adorned with Flowers</br>
A girl must be innocent</br>
Or she is ultimately alone</br>
She is raised to be slaughtered</br>
Her purity fetishized</br>
</br>
By sick men, she was fetishized</br>
They languished over her fertility</br>
Her mother kept her from the slaughtered</br> 
When she sent her to pick flowers</br>
But every girl is one day alone</br>
Smelling of innocent</br>
</br>
The man’s putrid retch mixed with her innocent</br>
Unaware she was being fetishized</br>
On the day she was alone</br>
She did not know yet of fertility</br>
She just wanted to pick flowers</br>
But instead, she was slaughtered</br>
</br>
I felt like you when I was slaughtered</br>
freshly fifteen, I was innocent</br>
Between my legs were flowers</br>
But my consequential masochism was fetishized</br>
I also became a young goddess of fertility</br>
Gutted, Eviscerated, then left alone</br>
</br>
Did you feel alone?</br>
In the underworld where your girlhood was slaughtered</br>
 When you stood for only fertility</br>
 Did you let the darkness become fetishized? </br>
 Did you breathe in his awful flowers?</br>
</br>
Did your world seem all pink flowers,</br>
Because you finally weren’t alone?</br>
Did you brush aside being fetishized,</br>
Because you thought you deserved to be Slaughtered?</br>
 Did you pride yourself on lack of innocent,</br>
Did you become his little fertility?</br>
</br>
Did you succumb to his fertility?</br>
Did you let him eat your flowers?</br>
Thinking you’d always be innocent,</br>
The furthest thing from alone?</br>
Knowing, slightly, you were being slaughtered,</br>
Secretly loving to be fetishized?</br>
</br>
Did the reality of being fetishized, </br>
Fifteen, a symbol of fertility</br>
Set in while you were slaughtered?</br>
Did you gather up your flowers</br>
Tearfully, suicidally alone</br>
The furthest thing from innocent?</br>
</br>
Did you lose your friends when you became un-innocent,</br>
Did you feel empty and fetishized,</br>
Truly, completely alone?
With one trait, fertility</br>
No one wanted your damaged flowers</br>
Now that your softness was slaughtered.</br>
</br>
I, like you, was slaughtered</br>
A horrifically complacent Innocent</br>
But i willingly gave my flowers</br>
Silent when fetishized</br>
I was the opposite of fertility</br>
The only thing I propagated was being alone</br>
</br>
For some reason, I want you to know I’m not alone</br>
I rose again from the slaughtered</br>
Slicky reclaiming fertility</br>
I won’t let myself be fetishized</br>
 I grew my own flowers</br>
</br>
But now when im touched, im always slaughtered</br>
 I feel guilty, far away, and fetishized</br>
Irreparable damage to the flowers</br>
</br></br></br>
</p>
<h2>Rationale:</h2>
<p>
I retold the myth of Persephone through a double sestina. I included motifs of flowers, youth, and fertility to allude to the original myth. The sestina is from the perspective of a modern young girl who, like Persephone, has suffered at the hands of a man who fetishized her. My retelling points out the gruesome details of Persephone’s story that I personally find very disturbing through questions to Persephone herself. Why was her kidnapping glorified? Why was the goddess of fertility so young? My sestina demonstrates how Persephone’s story could be viewed in a modern context.
