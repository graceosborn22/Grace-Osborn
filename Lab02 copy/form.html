            <div class="wrapper">
                <div class="box a"> <p>Post-punk is a genre of music that that emerged in the late 1970s and carried until the end of the 80s. It is characterized by elements of punk combined with other genres such as coldwave or darkwave, depending on the band. These elements often included synthesizers and heavy guitar effects. It's difficult to describe, because it's so broad, but when people talk about goth music, these bands are often the biggest influences. Goth is too narrow a label to fit all of these bands in, though, so I used a broader label that encompasses all of them.* </p>

            <p>*Also calling the Smiths goth in any way is a profound insult to goth, no matter how you define it.</p>
