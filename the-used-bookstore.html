    i had a dream you found a new girlfriend </br>

in the used bookstore</br>

we walked inside together</br>

i came out alone</br>

i left for i thought merely a moment</br>

to pluck a volume off the shelf</br>

but when i came back</br>

you had grown old and gray with someone else</br>
</br>

me still in my young, thin body</br>

littered with acne scars</br>

mouth agape</br>

when i saw her wrinkly hand in yours</br>
</br>

when your eyes met mine</br>

they twinkled</br>

as if tickling an old memory</br>

“well”</br>

you explained, </br>

and i could tell your heart was breaking</br>

“you had been gone so long</br>

i had to move on</br>

i had to stop searching”</br>
</br></br></br>
