    <h2>you may forget the warmth he gave</h2>
    <p>
        <i>after Emily Dickinson's 47.</i>
    </br></br>
    on the back porch laid my heart</br>

just above the place where we</br>

laid together, miles away. no one will</br>

find us, now i claw to forget</br>

the red sheen, indentations of him</br>
</br>

when my brain sprints, it always finds you</br>

your soft, wretched hands and</br>

crushed cherries, “i</br>

want you tonight”</br>
</br>

a dull knife was you</br>

i was locked away by the first of may</br>

clutching our dwindling metal underbelly, “forget</br>

it all”. they command, “the</br>

arms around your warmth</br>

will get weaker and he</br>

will fade, what he gave</br>
</br>

was rancid and i</br>

think i'm starting to get my will</br>

again, but to forget</br>

is never an option, the</br>

crushing of my hip bones the blinding light</br>
</br>

my red ribbons strangle me when</br>

i think of you</br>

the guilt oh god, i have</br>

shattered a thousand vases what have i done</br>

the only option was to pray</br>

to ask the vines, stained to tell</br>

me to stop breathing tell me</br>
</br>

the hands were supposed to be there that</br>

my disheveled pink hair was picturesque. i</br>

wrung out my arms and legs but my</br>

stickiness wouldn’t dissipate the thoughts</br>

were solid, as the world began to dim</br>
