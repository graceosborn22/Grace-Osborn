    <h2>game room</h2>
    <p>
    </br></br>
    my home is a room </br>

    a room where i reside , soul warm and arms intertwined </br>
    
    My Place for the last forever//never of my life</br>
    
    the room where the world’s glare became softer</br>
    
    where i plummeted into an Orange Summer Sunrise</br>
</br>
    
    there's a home for every skin cell, every bone</br>
    
    every thought i've never had</br>
    
    in Her every particle</br>

</br>
    
    my head on Her Shoulders while sounds surround</br>
    
    splintering shards of sorrow spiral through the ground</br>
</br>
    
    where i took a few steps back from the Ledge</br>
    
    i’ve been living on ever since my thirteenth birthday</br>
    
    Her comforting words led me astray</br>
    
    She grabbed my hand and pulled me closer, whispering</br>
    
    “please, please stay.”</br>
</br>
    
    enveloped in citrus</br>
    
    and ginger</br>
    
    and green</br>

</br>
    
    the patience of past lifetimes</br>
    
    and present infinities</br>

</br>
    
    i've learned to let my breaths slow</br>
    
    in the presence of star wars legos</br>
    
    to let the Clouds linger---</br>

</br>
    
    in a windy sky</br>
    
    it's in that room i’ve reshaped my whole life</br>
    
    decided finally--</br>

</br>
    
    to commit to living It.</br>

</br>
    
    but the room couldn’t contain all of the home</br>
    
    i reside in Her arms and her Soul</br>
</br></br></br>
